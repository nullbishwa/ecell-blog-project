## 🔧 Environment Variables Setup

### Backend (.env)
Create `backend/.env` file with:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ecell-blog?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-make-it-long-and-random-for-production
PORT=5000
```

### Frontend (.env)
Create `frontend/.env` file with:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api
```

## 🌐 Deployment Steps

### 1. MongoDB Setup
- Create a MongoDB Atlas account
- Create a new cluster
- Get your connection string
- Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster>` in MONGO_URI

### 2. Render Deployment

#### Backend:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Set build command: `npm install`
4. Set start command: `npm start`
5. Add environment variables:
   - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A long random string
   - `PORT`: 5000

#### Frontend:
1. Create a new Static Site
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `build`
4. Add environment variable:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Your backend URL + `/api`

### 3. Create Admin User
After deployment, you'll need to manually create an admin user in MongoDB:
```javascript
{
  "name": "Admin User",
  "email": "admin@ecell.com",
  "password": "hashed_password", // Use bcrypt to hash
  "role": "admin"
}
```
